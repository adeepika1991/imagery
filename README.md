I was also asked to do the forms for this assignment. But I don't have enough time to complete. So i just attached as a component but never imported in the App file. You can see the code though. 

The inspiration for my form component comes from my very own codesandbox which i did a month ago. Though it does have more fields and i took what I needed. Afterall React is made for Re-Usable components.
